## Dependencies and System requirements
The application relies on the latest version of ruby (2.7.0) being installed on your machine. You can check the version installed on your machine with the command `ruby -v`
If this does not show 2.7.0, you will need to update your version of ruby using Ruby Version Manager (RVM).
If you have RVM installed, use the command `rvm install 2.7.0` then `rvm use 2.7.0 --default`
If you do not have RVM installed, you can install it with the command `\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby`
